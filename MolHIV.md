Here, you will find experiments for the dataset Mol-HIV. The task here is to predict the number of spectral peaks. We experiment with several frameworks -

1) Vanilla-GNN + PDNConv - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjkx15x_3HTyl-oMvpbSRGPsisKOyzXS/view?usp=sharing)
2) Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation without edge attributes - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HOpwHf6RYpFZ4vbOctcwUXupKZMR26H3?usp=sharing)
